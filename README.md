HellForge sends Evernote clippings to Twitter, automatically.
=============================================================

**Is that it?** Yup.

**Can I see an example?** [@usersinhell on Twitter](http://twitter.com/usersinhell). These are posted from my [Evernote UI notebook](http://phillipcohen.net/hellbits_notebook).

**Is it ready yet?** Yes, though you'll need to edit the source to pick what notebook you want.

**What does it run on?** Microsoft Windows. Requires .NET 4.

**Why's it called HellForge?** Because it's used for my blog, [Users in Hell](http://usersinhell.com).
